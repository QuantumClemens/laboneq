    A renamed backend package keeps its predecessor's entry point registered

    backend name. Whichever loads second either registers over the first or
    dies on a module the old install no longer ships, decided by nothing more
    than entry point ordering.

    Reporting the clash rather than picking a winner is deliberate. A wrong
    pick compiles experiments against a stale backend, which is worse than
    refusing to start, and no environment is better off running with two.

    Which distribution is obsolete is left unsaid. Versions do not settle it:
    a superseded pair can share one, and the newer install is not reliably the
    surviving one. Naming the wrong package would send the user to uninstall
    the one they need.

    Keys off distribution metadata instead of package names, so it needs no
    upkeep as backends come and go.
