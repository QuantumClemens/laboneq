            decoded to natural units; raw integers at native width).
        valid: Boolean mask, same shape as `data`. True where a value was
            recorded; False where a slot was never written (early-exit
            do_until iteration, match arm with fewer updates, etc.).
        axis_name: Axis labels, parallel to AcquiredResult.axis_name.
        axis: Axis grids, parallel to AcquiredResult.axis.
        last_nt_step: Near-time progress for partial NT runs; None otherwise.
