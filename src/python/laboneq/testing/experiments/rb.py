    """Settings for a single-qubit randomized benchmark (RB) experiment parallelized to
    multiple qubits.

    Definitions:
        - A RB sequence of length `m` is an ordered collection of `m` randomly chosen
          Clifford gates, recovery gate, and a measurement; all scheduled to be applied
          in parallel on qubits with ids `qubit_ids`.
        - Repetition `k` is the k'th instance of RB sequence of length `m`.
        - Iteration `m` is `n_repeat` repetitions of a RB sequence of length `m`.
        - Shot `n` is the n'th "copy" of `len(sequence_lengths)` iterations.

    !!! tip
        To optimize use of waveform memory, ensure all lengths are a multiple of the
        system timing grid.

    Important to note here is that all shots are identical.

    To generate the random numbers, `numpy.random.default_rng` is used with the seed attribute.

    Attributes:
        seed: A non-negative integer for seeding the PRNG.
        qubit_ids: Labels for the qubits, e.g. ["q0", "q1", ...].
        sequence_lengths: An ordered set of numbers to use as sequence length at each
            RB iteration.  E.g., `sequence_lengths=[1, 2]`, implies 2 iteration RB with 1
            and 2 randomly chosen Clifford gates applied in each iteration.
        n_average: Number of repetitions of the full experiment.  Only the final averaged
            results are kept.
        n_repeat: Number of repetitions per sequence length.  Each repetition
            will yield a sample in the results.
        relaxation_length: Relaxation time between iterations.
        excitation_length: Duration of each drive (gate) pulse. Used to build the
            Clifford gate pulse map.
        pi_pulse_amp: Amplitude of the pi-rotation drive pulse.
        pi_half_pulse_amp: Amplitude of the pi/2-rotation drive pulse.
        prereadout_delay: Delay to apply before readout pulse.
        excitation_frequencies: Drive frequency of each qubit, keyed by qubit id.
        readout_frequencies: Readout frequency of each qubit, keyed by qubit id.
        sg_lo_frequencies: Local-oscillator frequency of each qubit's drive (SG)
            channel, keyed by qubit id. The drive IF is set to
            `excitation_frequency - sg_lo_frequency`.
        qa_lo_frequencies: Local-oscillator frequency of each qubit's readout (QA)
            channel, keyed by qubit id. The readout IF is set to
            `readout_frequency - qa_lo_frequency`.
        measure_pulse: Pulse used in readout signals.
        acquire_kernel: Integration kernel used in acquisition.
        acquisition_type: Acquisition mode used by the real-time acquire loop.
        averaging_mode: Averaging mode used by the real-time acquire loop.
        sg_modulation_type: Oscillator modulation type applied to the drive (SG) IF
            oscillator.
        qa_modulation_type: Oscillator modulation type applied to the readout (QA) IF
            oscillator.
        sg_range: Range to set in the SignalCalibration of the drive (SG) channel.
            If set to None, uses the default settings.
